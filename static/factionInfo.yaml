    compete aggressively amongst themselves and with companies outside the State,

  description: The origin of Mordu's Legion lies in the Gallente-Caldari War when
    a group of Intaki military personnel sided with the Caldari. The Intakis were
    put into a separate unit with a Caldari officer named Mordu. After the war the
    Intakis settled in Caldari space, but unwillingly became entangled with Caldari
    locals in the Waschi Uprising. Mordu's Legion was formed at that time as a mercenary
    fighting force and after the uprising it continued its existence. The Legion is
    loosely associated with the Caldari Navy, but is for the most part totally independent.
    Mordu's Legion is commonly hired by companies to protect valuable assets outside
    empire space, for instance Outer Ring Excavations pays them handsomely to patrol
    the Outer Ring region.

    have undertaken. It was formed some 30 years ago to act as a neutral passenger
    transportation company that would span the entire known world. Since then it has
    evolved a bit, especially when it started to ferry goods too. The InterBus is
    used by the SCC to ferry goods between stations, as they are reliable and operate
    in every station in the world. As InterBus has to operate not only in empire stations,
    but also in pirate havens and other stations associated with organized crime,
    the company has to uphold a very strict policy regarding neutrality and secrecy.
    Even if the company is owned by the empires, no information regarding to shipments
    or station locations is ever given out. The strict adherence to these rules has
    allowed InterBus to operate without harassment in every corner of the world of
    EVE, making them one of the pillars of the inter-stellar community.

    calling them Ammatars. Today, the Ammatars enjoy a semi-autonomy in their own

    was taking off. Sansha was a Caldari tycoon that carved out a sizeable piece of
    space for himself. There, he set out to create an utopian state. His vision and
    charm attracted thousands of people and for some time the Nation flourished. But
    Sansha became ever more warped as his success increased. He started experiments,
    combining capsule technology with the human mind, creating zombie-like creatures
    that had the cold, calculating mind of a computer, but the ingenuity of humans.
    When this became public knowledge Sansha was condemned and the other empires joined
    forces to bring him down. His forces were decimated and scattered to the winds.
    Remnants still remain far in the outer regions, but the once glorious Nation has
    been reduced to pirates and pillagers.

    early on to provide protection for his stations and the duty was taken on by the
    Guardian Angels. Both sides have prospered enormously for this deal - Serpentis
    can operate in peace and the Angel Cartel gets access to the illegal research
    efforts of the Serpentis. It is strongly believed that Serpentis is the main developer
